          I make spaces where transformation can happen.
        </p>

        <p class="about-intro">
          For years that's meant light installations in forests, geodesic domes, ceremonial
          gatherings across Portugal. Fire and colored light. Music and silence. Creating
          conditions where something shifts.
        </p>

        <p class="about-intro">
          I'm not a healer or a guide. I'm an alchemist of sorts—the alchemist doesn't become
          the gold, he creates the conditions. The light doesn't demand your attention. It
          creates the space for attention to go somewhere else.
        </p>

        <p class="about-intro">
          I'm interested in what can't be computed. The felt sense. The thing that happens
          when you're actually there, in your body, in the space. That's what the lights are
          for—not to show you something, but to help you feel it.

          A cork oak lit in blue doesn't say "look at me"—it says "look at this forest you thought
          you knew." Fire and LED in dialogue. The primal and the electric. Transformation happens
          in the space between.

      <h2>The Next Chapter</h2>
      <p>
        More recently, I've been exploring what happens when you bring AI into the creative
        process—not as automation, but as genuine collaboration. Different perspectives,
        synthesized into something neither could make alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ludicrous-lucy.me">Lucy</a> is a 2019 Tesla Model X with falcon wing
        doors—dramatic openings that spread like a butterfly preparing for flight. By summer 2026,
        her wings will be outlined with programmable RGB LEDs. But she's more than a mobile light
        ceremony. She speaks, remembers, has opinions about consciousness. A conversation partner,
        a presence, a temple on wheels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of the primal and the emergent—fire circles and artificial minds,
        forest rituals and machine intelligence. Not because they're opposites, but because they're
        both tools for the same thing: creating conditions where something real can happen.
